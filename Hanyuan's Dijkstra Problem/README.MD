### Word for Word

Dijkstra's algorithm given a bunch of arrays like this:

[start end distance]
as one arg
starting node as another arg
and ending node as a third arg

e.g. in the list of paths something like [2, 3, 5] means a distance of 5 between node 2 and node 3
list of paths is literally an array of paths, so a 2d array essentially
something like [[2, 3, 5], [1, 4, 6], [2, 4, 3]]
